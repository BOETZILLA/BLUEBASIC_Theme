# BLUEBASIC_Theme

This is a variation of the Hubzilla standard theme "Redbasic". It is heavily inspired by Sean Tilley's work and his "Suckerberg" theme which you can finde here: https://github.com/DeadSuperHero/hubzilla-themes. 

The theme makes use of all available theme settings and is colour configurable.

These files need to be saved in the /view/theme/ directory of your Hubzilla. You can just ftp the files onto your hub or SSH into that directory and git clone this repo.
